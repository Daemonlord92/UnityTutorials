You arise to see the ship that carried you and your
 squad is destroyed! Your Teammates mangled bodies lay
  across the ground. You look around to see what you can do?

  A. Savage the Wreakage.

  B. Bury the dead.

A. You start carefully going through the ruin of the ship. You find a couple medkits, a rifle, a vial of timjonix, and couple clips. With the timjonix you know from training you can rig to fuel any starship but wiether it can return to your homeworld you do not know. Hour passed and you finish, the smell of the bodies reak. Might be something with the Atmosphere caused rapid decomposition. Looking up I see a trail that vears off into the brush, or there is the path but this world and enities are unknown to me?

A. Do you take the hidden brush path!

B. Do you take the well traveled path!


B. As you find a shovel to bury the dead, you start going through the different memories. Adventure across different planets, discovering ecosystems and different materials. It takes an hour to complete the burial, you say a pray in their religion. When you look up to see a preset duffal bag: A shotgun with a 2 boxes of shells, 5 super medkits, 3 Skeleton Key Programs. As you collect the Duffal bag, you look to see a trail that vears off into the brush, or there is the path but this world and enities are unknown to me?

A. Do you take the hidden brush path!

B. Do you take the well traveled path!
